Monologue
=========

**Intro sequence:**
Commander’s Log, Day 1. We’re about to arrive on the space station Aeneas. What makes this station so special is the fact that it’s completely modular. However, this also means that there’s quite a bit of work ahead of us to get it up and running.

*Gameplay starts:*
We’ve brought some resources with us and we should put them to good use. A storage module will give us a place to put them before we go any further.
> Storage module is highlighted in building list 

*After storage module constructed:*
Great, now we can actually store the supplies we brought.
> Highlight resources at top of screen
Our next priority is to look after our electricity production. We need to construct two solar panels so we have enough power to run this thing. It might be useful to build some empty modules first so we have space for the panels.
> Solar panels and empty modules are highlighted and enabled in building list.

*After solar panels constructed:*
Let’s keep in mind these things don’t produce electricity at night. Gotta watch out for our battery capacities.
Now we need to build a place to sleep. 
> Sleeping module is highlighted and enabled in building list

*After sleeping chamber constructed:*
Now we’ve got all the basics done to survive up here. We will receive periodic shipments of the necessary supplies like food, water, oxygen or raw materials. We need to use the command module to give an order for tomorrow.
> Tool Tip: click on command module, use sliders to adjust order of the next day
We need to make sure to always order enough oxygen, water and food. But then we also need building materials to expand the station.
> Tool Tip: hover over resource to see requirement

**Day 2:**
Commander’s Log, Day 2. What a beautiful sight to see the glowing sun emerge behind the blue marble of our planet.
Sleeping in zero g was quite an unusual experience, it will take some time to get used to that.

*Transport ship is closing in*
The daily shipment is about to arrive, let’s see what they brought us this time.

*After Transport ship has docked*
The ship will leave again in one minute. It will not be able to give us any materials that we don’t have room for.
We’ll be able to expand our station with what we’ve got. If we could become more self sufficient, a smaller portion of the payload would need to be used for necessities.
> All modules in building list except cryogenic chamber are unlocked. Plant module and hydrolysis module are highlighted.

*Near the end of the second day:*
We’ll need to select a shipment for the next day. Maybe getting some more crew up here wouldn’t be a bad idea. They will want their own sleeping chambers, though.

**Day 3:**
Commander’s Log, Day 3. We’re slowly getting used to the situation up here.
Some recent missions from the space agency have brought asteroids in orbit around earth. Maybe we could tap into those resources. We’ll need to build a rocket module for that.

**Random logs:**
Commander’s Log, Day x.
> Before the war. One of the following options:
- It’s all quiet up here. Nothing special’s happening today.
- Another beautiful day up here. Well there’s not exactly a thing like bad weather in space, is there?
- When I look down at the earth like this, I do miss my family. They’re down there on this huge world. But now we got a small world of our own up here.
- We’re hearing stories of political turmoil down on earth. None of that matters to us as long as we get our shipments on time.
- Sometimes I miss life on Earth. But it’s important work we’re doing up here.
- I’m looking forward to holding my son again. But I won’t be back on earth for another three months.
- Occasionally I see some asteroids getting within a few kilometers of us. But I shouldn’t worry about it.
- There have been no unusual events lately.
- Sometimes I hear a bit of creaking in the storage module. The other crew members assured me that there is nothing to worry about.
- The collaboration in the crew is working really well. I am glad to see that everyone adjusted so well to life in space.
- It is impressive to see the collaboration among our crew despite the fact that we come from very different countries and cultures.
- Every day I am up here makes me feel proud to do this for my country and humanity as a whole.
- The Aeneas is coming along pretty nicely. The new developments are promising.

> After the war. One of the following options:
- (Before trying to contact survivors) We haven’t received any signals since … the war. I wonder if anyone survived?
- When I look down at earth now, I am overwhelmed with a feeling of sadness that humanity has actually wiped itself out.
- Once again, there was no light to be seen on the night side of the earth.
- We’re alive up here while everyone is dead down there on earth. Sometimes I wonder if it’s even worth it to keep going.
- Every time I wake up, I hope that this was all a dream… I just want to see my family again.
- Seeing the dead planet below me makes me feel so … powerless.
- There are no more shipments from Earth’s surface. Unless there’s some sort of miracle, our fate will be the same as the one of our brothers on Earth.
- I would have rather spent the last days of my life with my family than on this station.
- (Before trying to contact survivors) We haven’t given up hope on finding survivors yet. We just need to scan for their signals.
- (After trying to contact survivors) We’re the only humans left… We’re humanity’s last hope. We can’t give up now.
- Some of the crew are freaking out. They’ve lost their families, they’ve lost their countries. But maybe, maybe there’s a way we can survive.
- We are struggling to keep going. 

> After war, when all lines are used up
Why am I even still doing this? It’s not like anyone’s ever going to listen to these logs anyway.

> At any point:
- (If oxygen is getting low) The oxygen levels of the ship are quite concerning. If we don’t find a solution soon, we will suffocate.
- (If oxygen level critical) It’s almost impossible to breathe. *Cough* Is this the end?
- (If oxygen levels were low the day before but no longer) It seems like the oxygen situation has stabilized. We’ve got some breathing room now, quite literally.
- (If water is getting low) We’re all thirsty here. We really need to get access to fresh water.
- (If water critical) My throat feels so dry. *Cough* Need water.
- (If food is getting low) The crew’s been complaining that we don’t get enough food. Our situation is indeed quite dire.
- (If food critical) We won’t hold out much longer if we can’t get anything to eat.
- (If electricity low) Our batteries are almost dry. This would have terrible consequences for the operation of our ship.
- (If electricity critical) We have no power left. The systems of the station are shutting down and we’re freezing.

**Event: Start of the War**
What the fuck is that? … Explosions?
The headquarter is not responding. What the hell is going on?
We’re seeing World War Three unfold right below us. This is horrifying.
Sarah … Robin … NO!
We’ve gotten reports that all nations have crumbled…
What does this mean for us? There certainly won’t be any more supply ships now.

*Morning after War*

Seeing the dark side of earth devoid of any light is haunting. How terrible.
Is it possible at least someone survived? We should use a radio antenna to look for signals.
> Radio antenna module is highlighted.

*If radio antenna module is built*
> Button with „scan for signals“ is shown and highlighted

**Event: Trying to contact survivors**
We didn’t receive any signals. At all. This means there were no survivors… We’re alone now.
It will take years for the surface of the Earth to be habitable again. But there needs to be a ways how we can preserve humanity.
> Cryogenic sleeping module is highlighted and enabled in building list.

*After cryogenic sleeping module is constructed:*
We can now preserve our bodies until the surface of Earth is habitable again. We have lost our families, but we have save our species. The world has ended, but we managed to keep a small world alive up here.

**Event: Eclipse**
Would you look at that? An eclipse in space. But this does mean that that our solar panels won’t be working for a while.

**Event: Debris Impact**
Shit, it looks like some space debris has hit our station. We need to repair the hole before too much oxygen drains.

**Event: Solar Flare**
(Before World War) Scientists have predicted increased solar activity today. This means any electrical device not protected by a magnet will work very unreliably. Luckily, the earth’s magnetic field protects us from these effects.
(After World War) Our sensors indicate that the sun is heavily active today. The nuclear bombs of the war have changed the Earth’s magnetic field so much that it won’t protect us. We need to set up our own magnets
> Highlight magnet module in building menu

**Event: Launch Failure**
I just received the message that there’s been a failure in the launch of today’s supply rocket. There won’t be another delivery until tomorrow. We’ll have to see how we manage.
